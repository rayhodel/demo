# Project Task Instructions

## Introduction
This document provides guidelines on how to structure and document tasks for the Space Invaders .NET Core MVC project. Each task should be detailed in its own markdown file within the `tasks/` directory, following a consistent format to ensure clarity and ease of tracking progress.

## Task Files

Organize your tasks in a structured format using the following files

`tasks/Task <number> - <Task Name>.md`:

```markdown
# Task <number> - <Task Name>
